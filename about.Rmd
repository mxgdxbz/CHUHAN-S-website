### Professional Experience  
**Hospital for Special Surgery, Data Research Intern**     
 ▪ Communicated with lead surgeons and cooperatively identified promising variables with impact on hospital-acquired infection (HAI) rate both in operative procedure and post-operative care of spinal surgeries      
 ▪ Analyzed survey data collected from surgeons, anesthetists as well as assistants and successfully identified a latent variable (team consistency level) in estimating HAI rate, which reduce model prediction error by twenty percent  
 ▪ Applied regression modeling in R on 20+ variables with nested cross-validation in support of model selection         
 ▪ Generated visualizations including correlograms, tables as well as graphs and reported results to data manager periodically    

**Boehringer-Ingelheim CO., Quality Assurance Intern**     
 ▪ Monitored medicines quality through gathering and analyzing related quality reports to detect potential quality issues     
 ▪ Supported CAPA revision and implemented effective corrective or preventive actions to assure safe medicines supply    
 ▪ Connected with downstream suppliers and reviewed qualification documents to ensure their adherence to GMP standard    
 ▪ Worked as the head intern to lead intern training session and inspire team spirit

### Research Experience
**Columbia Univ., Dept. of Biostatistics, Investigator**     
▪ Cooperatively develop a project to investigate determinants of racial survival disparities in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer      
▪ Effectively researched on survey data as well as medical records and extracted 1500+ eligible records for further analysis  
▪	Employed both parametric methods (Accelerated Failure Time) and Semi-parametric methods (Proportional Hazards Model) to separately quantify the effect of diagnosis stage and surgery waiting time on racial survival disparities  
▪	Examined the mediation effect of diagnosis stage and surgery waiting time in a self-motivating manner, which played an important role in improving model accuracy and interpretation  

**[Smoking in the Framingham Heart Study](https://github.com/mxgdxbz/Framingham-Heart-study), Course Project**  
▪	Described the smoking habits of the participants in the Framingham Heart study as they age   
▪	Determined the impact of smoking on certain health outcomes,including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and serum total cholesterol.  

**[Machine Learning Techniques in Transaction Data](https://github.com/mxgdxbz/Transaction-Data), Course Project**    
▪ Identified key determinants closely related to consumer purchase capability and predicted their total expenditure on black friday   
▪ Clustered consumers based on their shopping records so as to estimate their purchase pattern and help providers tailor advertizing in a way attractive to the target groups of consumers.  

### Software Skills    
▪	Proficiency in R (Data Wrangling, Statistical Analysis, Visualization) and MS Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access)  
▪	Effective use of SAS (Base Programmer Certificated), Python, SQL, SPSS   
▪	Familiarity with Tableau, Mplus
