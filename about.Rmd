###Research Experience  
**Columbia Univ., Dept. of Biostatistics, Investigator**  
*  Cooperatively develop research project to investigate determinants of survival disparities in patients with colorectal cancer  
*  Manipulate survey data and medical records from CanCORS study and extract eligible records for survival analysis   
*  Employ both parametric methods (Accelerated Failure Time) and Semi-parametric methods (Proportional Hazards Model) to evaluate possible effect of surgery waiting time on racial differences in survival rate   
*  Perform mediation analysis in R to examine how surgery waiting time mediates between race and survival time and quantify its contribution to survival disparities between white and non-white patients  
**Hospital for Special Surgery, Data Research Intern**  
*  Communicated with lead surgeons and cooperatively identified promising variables with impact on hospital-acquired infection (HAI) rate both in operative procedure and post-operative care of spinal surgeries  
*  Designed a method to quantify team consistency level of each spinal surgery based on survey data collected from surgeons, anesthetists as well as assistants and transferred result into a new variable in building models to estimate HAI rate   
*  Applied regression modeling in R on variables of interest with nested cross-validation in support of model selection   
*  Generated visualizations including correlograms, tables as well as graphs and reported results to data manager periodically
