Hi,   
  
I am a second-year graduate student in Biostatistics at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health and will be graduating this summer. I completed my undergraduate study at Fudan University and acquired my BS degree in Pharmaceutical Science in 2017. I have been passionate about the analytical skills in the healthcare practice, especially for **drug development** and **clinical trials**. So I decided to study Biostatistics for graduate study. Also, I took an intership last summer at Hospital for Special Surgery where I was mainly responsible for the **data manipulation** and **statistical analysis** job. This experience gave me a lot of practice in using R, SAS as well as SQL. Now, I almost complete the required courses in my program and am looking for a **full-time analyst position** in Healthcare Company, Research Institute or Pharma. I am confident that my combined knowledge of biostatistics and research experiences will enable me to be a qualified data analyst. More information about me can be reached [here](about.html).

Please feel free to contact me if my background interests you.

Regards,

  
Chuhan
