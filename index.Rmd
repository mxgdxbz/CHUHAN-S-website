Hi,

<p style="text-align:justify;">   
I'm a fresh graduate from Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health, with an **M.S. degree in Biostatistics**. I completed my undergraduate study at Fudan University and acquired my **B.S. degree in Pharmaceutical Science**. I have been passionate about data analytics in the healthcare practice, especially for its use in new drug development and clinical trial design to drive innovative solutions.  
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
Hoping to extend my research and analytical skills to the healthcare industry, I really value the work opportunities for biostatistician/data analyst/statistical programmer. 
I am confident that my knowledge of the **health industry** combined with professional experiences in **data management** and **statistical analysis (R, SQL, SAS - Base & Advanced Programmer Certification)** will enable me to fill your requirements effectively.  Working on your team is also of great importance for me to gain more hands-on experience in this field.
