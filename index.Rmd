Hi,

<p style="text-align:justify;">   
I am a second-year graduate student in **Biostatistics** at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health and will be graduating this summer. I completed my undergraduate study at Fudan University and acquired my B.S. degree in **Pharmaceutical Science**. I have been passionate about data analytics in the healthcare practice, especially for its use in new drug development and clinical trial design to drive innovative solutions. That is why I transferred to Biostatistics for graduate study. I joined Hospital for Special Surgery last summer as a data research intern and was mainly responsible for the **data manipulation** and **statistical analysis** work in our team. This experience gave me a lot of practice in **R** and **SAS ** to analyze large-scale electronic medical records.  
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  
Now, I almost complete the required courses in my program and am looking for a **full-time analyst position** in Healthcare Company, Research Institute or Pharma. I am confident that my combined knowledge of biostatistics and professional experience will enable me to be qualified for this role.

Warm Regards,



Chuhan
