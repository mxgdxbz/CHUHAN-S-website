Hi,

<p style="width:50%;text-align:justify;">   
I am a second-year graduate student in Biostatistics at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health and will be graduating this summer. I completed my undergraduate study at Fudan University and acquired my BS degree in Pharmaceutical Science. I have been passionate about **data analytics** in the healthcare practice, especially for its use in new drug development and clinical trial design. That is why I transferred to Biostatistics for graduate study. I joined Hospital for Special Surgery last summer as a data research intern and was mainly responsible for the **data manipulation** and **statistical analysis** work in our team. This experience gave me a lot of practice in **R and SAS programming** to analyze large-scale electronic medical records. Now, I almost complete the required courses in my program and am looking for a **full-time analyst position** in Healthcare Company, Research Institute or Pharma. I am confident that my combined knowledge of biostatistics and research experiences will enable me to be qualified for this role. More information about me can be reached [here](about.html).

Please feel free to contact me if my background interests you.


Warm Regards,



Chuhan
