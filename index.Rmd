Hi, I am a second-year graduate student at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health. I completed my undergraduate study at Fudan University and acquired my BS degree in Pharmaceutical Science in 2017. I have been passionate about the analytical skills in the healthcare practice, especially for drug development and clinical trials. So I decided to study Biostatistics for graduate study. Also, I took an intership last summer at Hospital for Special Surgery where I was mainly responsible for the data manipulation job under their internal projects. This experience gave me a lot of practice in using R, SAS as well as SQL. Now, I almost complete the required courses in my program and will be graduating this year in May. I am looking for a full-time analyst position to start my career in Pharma, Research Institute or Healthcare Company. I am confident that I am well equipped with the skills in both study design and statistical analysis. My projects can be reached [here](https://github.com/mxgdxbz).
